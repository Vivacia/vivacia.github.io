        <p>Hello there.</p>
        <p>I'm Meghavarnika Budati, but I prefer to be called Varnika. I'm a 3rd year CS major at Georgia Tech. My threads are Systems & Architecture and Information Internetworks. Switched out of Intelligence! You could say I'm from Kuwaitâ€”I was born there and have spent about 12 years of my life there. It's a place where nothing happens.</p>
        <p>My interests in CS are working with OSes, low-level computing, embedded systems and information security. I have a good bit of AI knowledge and done some projects with respect to that. Android dev is something I would like to avoid though. :)</p>
        <p>I used to be a TA for cs2110: Computer Organization and Programming, where I taught students basic computer architecture, circuitry, C and pedagogical assembly. I'm a part of SAIL, the Systems for AI Lab at GT, and have been working on two amazing projects: Modin and SRTML. Someday, I hope to be an expert in the field of systems, and maybe be a professor!</p>
