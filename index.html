        <p>Hello there.</p>
        <p>I'm Meghavarnika Budati, but I prefer to be called Varnika. I'm a 2nd year CS major at Georgia Tech. My threads are Systems & Architecture and Information Internetworks. Switched out of Intelligence! You could say I'm from Kuwaitâ€”I was born there and have spent about 12 years of my life there. It's a place where nothing happens.</p>
        <p>My interests in CS are working with OSes, low-level computing, embedded systems and security systems. I have a good bit of AI knowledge and done some projects with respect to that. Android dev is something I would like to avoid though. :)</p>
